Weâ€™ve created a simple internal platform that allows nanoservices to be uploaded, as code. It then allows a nanoservice to be executed on demand, via a RESTful API. There are no containers or servers dedicated to each nanoservice; instead, they all run on a shared platform. Which for us is a set of auto-scaling cloud instances.
