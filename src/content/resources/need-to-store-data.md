You can use things like localStorage or indexedDB to store data. But that data is only for the one person looking at your creation, it's not data stored in some permanent database that persists across time and sessions and all that. Need that? There are plenty of options. Also see <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/2018/05/04/say-you-need-to-get-set-some-json-data-from-a-pen/">options for getting/setting JSON data</a>.
