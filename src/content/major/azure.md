A major infrastructure provider with solutions for about just everything, and generally considered the least expensive. For working with cloud functions, there is an online editor, but it also allows GitHub sync and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions">integrates directly with VS Code</a>. Data storage is through Cosmos DB.
